<h1>Aikan Adventures</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Aikan Adventures is a two-dimensional scroller game where, our hero, Aikan is going around the world to make it safer to live in by using the arrow keys and the mouse to defeat his “enemies”.  In the game Aikan is given power ups to help him defeat his enemies, some power ups make Aikan faster others make him bigger and stronger. Aikan adventure is really fun, the goal of the game is that you have to defeat all the enemies and reach the other side or the end of the map. On your way to the other side there will be many things that will slow you down such as enemies, the time limit, your health/ damage, and poisons these types are in the game to challenge the players and make it fun as well. Another thing that makes the game more difficult is the fact that each time you defeat your enemy they come faster. But if you ever get low on health or you get a negative effect, you can just pick a powerup and just keep going, you can even change the time limit, so you have a better chance to win! Its up to Aikan to save the world, he is the world's only chance.  So can you make it to the end and save the world? Its up to you.</p>
